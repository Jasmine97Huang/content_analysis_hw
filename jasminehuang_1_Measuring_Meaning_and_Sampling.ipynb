              "{'article': ['Kanye West is getting a few things off his chest with some new music.The 44-year-old rapper and fashion mogul, who now goes by Ye, shared his fiery track “Eazy” with The Game on Friday (Jan. 14). In the nearly four-minute track, Ye unleashes on Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, who is dating his estranged wife Kim Kardashian.“God saved me from that crash/ Just so I can beat Pete Davidson’s ass,” Ye spits, referencing his near-fatal car accident in 2002.Referring to himself as “Mr. Narcissist,” Ye also raps that he and Kardashian are having the “best divorce ever.” The reality TV star and shapewear mogul filed for divorce in February 2021.“If we go to court, we’ll go to court together/ Matter of fact, pick up your sis, we’ll go to court together,” he raps.Later in the track, Ye — who recently purchased a house across from Kardashian — seemingly implies that he will have a different parenting style than his soon-to-be former wife. The two share four young children: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm.“I got love for the nannies, but real family is better/ The cameras watch the kids, y’all stop takin’ the credit,” Ye raps. “Non-custodial dad, I bought the house next door/ What you think the point of really bein’ rich for?”He adds, “Boujee and unruly, y’all need to do some chores/ Rich ass kids, this ain’t yo mama’s house.”Ye also throws in a line about his new romance with Julia Fox. “My new b—- bad, I know Illuminati mad,” the rapper says about the Uncut Gems actress, who he was first spotted with in December.Listen to Ye and The Game’s new song “Eazy” below on Spotify. The track is exclusive to Spotify for the first 24 hours of its release, a Spotify representative confirmed to Billboard.\\xa0',\n",

              "  'Sebastián Yatra‘s “Amor Pasajero” has topped this week’s new music poll.Music fans voted in a poll published Friday (Jan. 7) on Billboard, choosing the 27-year-old Colombian pop star’s sensual single as their favorite new music release of the past week.“Amor Pasajero,” the second single from Yatra’s upcoming album, Dharma, brought in nearly 44% of the vote, beating out new music by The Weeknd (Dawn FM), Lauren Spencer-Smith (“Fingers Crossed”), Gunna (DS4Ever), Maren Morris (“Circles Around This Town”), and others.Produced by hitmakers Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo, “Amor Pasajero” finds Yatra on a rollercoaster of emotions as he comes to terms with a failed relationship. “I’ve returned to the same bar to drink my sorrows away and meet someone that will make me forget you at least for a moment,” he sings.Yatra’s third studio album, Dharma, is scheduled for release on Jan. 28.Placing second on the past week’s tally with 31% of the vote was The Weeknd’s fifth studio album, Dawn FM, which was released with little warning on Jan. 7. The 16-track set features collaborations with Quincy Jones,\\xa0Tyler, the Creator,\\xa0Lil Wayne,\\xa0Oneohtrix Point Never and unexpected appearances from actor and comedian Jim Carrey, who acts as a radio host in between the tracks.See the final results of this week’s new music release poll below.var pd_tags = new Array;pd_tags[\"11011211-src\"]=\"poll-oembed-simple\";\\xa0',\n",
              "  'Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and The Game are under fire by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) after they posted an image of a skinned monkey to promote their upcoming collaboration.On Thursday (Jan. 13), Ye and The Game posted identical images on Instagram to promote their new song. “MY LIFE WAS NEVER EASY,” they captioned their respective posts.PETA President Ingrid Newkirk gave\\xa0Billboard\\xa0a statement on Friday (Jan. 14) in response to the image the rappers posted on social media: “The photo is reminiscent of the monkeys PETA has found, sometimes heads, sometimes hands, sometimes the whole body, in meat markets around the world and it makes it clear that when you remove the fur you can’t miss that there’s a person in there, that they are fellow primates, and do not belong to us to abuse for any purpose — not in laboratories, roadside zoos, movies, or meat markets.”In a 2018 Billboard\\xa0interview, The Game said he still backed the controversial “Off the Grid” MC following his cringeworthy thoughts about slavery being a “choice” in the viral TMZ interview. “Kanye will always be a friend of mine & although I might not necessarily agree with his views on certain topics, that is what separate us as individuals,” he wrote in an email. The two have a long musical history, including their 2006 collab “Wouldn’t Get Far” and the Ye-produced “Dreams” off of The Game’s 2005 debut album, The Documentary.\\xa0The two were also spotted in the recording studio recently alongside fellow MCs A$AP Rocky and Pusha T as well as football player Antonio Brown, which has been stoking the flames on recent collab rumors.',\n",

The three-time Grammy nominee shared a second set of getaway photos of her in Montana enjoying cabin life, mountain terrain and horse rides. “On my \\xa0@isa.paige s–t,” she wrote, referring to popular nature YouTuber Isabel Paige.Though Cabello is on a break, she promised fans that her third album, Familia, will be arriving soon. “Feliz año nuevo!” Camila\\xa0shared via Instagram on New Year’s Eve. “Can’t wait to give you guys my/our next album, Familia\\xa0in 2022.”She also spoke with Billboard about what to expect from the upcoming body of work. “This album to me means community, I guess the opposite of you on your own. It’s more you with other people land sharing in that joy and success, whatever that means,” she told Billboard News. “Interdependence realizing how important everybody is in your life. A lot of it is inspired by my relationships: My relationships to my family, my relationship to my friends, my relationship to my partner … it’s all about connections with other people, hence, Familia.“See Cabello’s Instagram post below.',\n",

This notebook outlines scraping text from the web, from images, PDF and Word documents. Then we detail \"spidering\" or walking through hyperlinks to build samples of online content, and using APIs, Application Programming Interfaces, provided by webservices to access their content. Along the way, we will use regular expressions, outlined in the reading, to remove unwanted formatting and ornamentation. Finally, we discuss various text encodings, filtering and data structures in which text can be placed for analysis.\n",

        "WHAT - I want to analyze popular music lyrics (music appear on billboard top 100 and spotify data on Kaggle) in the past few decades (1970- 2010). I am especially interested in the semantic shifts of gendered insults in these cultural artifacts. Western popular culture has been heavily criticized for perpetuating hegemonic gender stereotypes. In particular, hip hop music has a bad reputation for violence and misogyny. However, pop cultural critics and scholars have noticed a rise in the \"reappropriation\" of gendered-insults directed towards women. That is, female artists have been using previously pejorative words in non-derogatory manners and purpose, thereby reclaiming their social connotations. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "WHY - Understanding whether there are large-scale changes in the meanings of gendered insults, quantify such shifts and identify among whom the insults remain stagmatizing is extremely important. Normalized misogyny and populaized sexualization of women can have serious consequences. Multiple lines of research have identified that misogynistic lyrical content and beliefs in traditonal gender roles are reliable predictors of female-directed aggression. Listening to music with pro-equality lyrics, on the other hand, improves attitudes and behaviors towards women. Additionally, consuming sexually objectifying content may lead to self-sexualization and self-objectification, which can have serious negative psychological consequences for women and girls.Gender-directed insult can be read as a direct demonstration of intense emotion such as misogyny towards the recipients. More importantly, gendered derogatory language serves the function of sanctioning actions by both genders that are deviant from socially accepted behaviors. The data from Spotify and Billboard are appropriate source as the songs are deemed popular through listeners' ranking and playlist exposure. A great limitation, however, is that the dataset is not sampled randomly from all the \"popular music\". Furthermore, demographic data of the artists are difficult to acquire. This will limit my ability of understand the effects of race and gender on the usage of sexist vocabularies. To really enhance my analysis, I need to figure out a way to get more representative sample of the \"popular music\" from the time frame that capture meaningful changes in attitudes towards women and the demographic information of the creators of the lyrics."
